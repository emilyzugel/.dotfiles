As you can see in WebExtensions API documentation or simplified tutorials, there's no way to apply any modifications to a web page without gaining the full access permission to that page. Stylus is mostly used to apply global themes, which is why it requests a global permission. In the future we might be able to implement a more granular approach but it's not exactly trivial.\n\n    Access your data for all websites - required for the style elements to be added into the page, not to access any of your data.\n    Access browser tabs - required to show styles in the popup, and for some auxiliary features like regexp tester in the editor.\n    Access browser activity during navigation - required to insert the styles at the exact moment the page is navigated to a different URL.\n    Identity - required for access to cloud services to allow importing and exporting of styles (e.g. Dropbox, etc).\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nUnlike other similar extensions, we don't find you to be all that interesting. Your questionable browsing history should remain between you and the NSA. Stylus collects nothing. Period.\n\n\nFirefox related notes\n\n    To import styles from Stylish add-on please read https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/FAQ#how-can-i-export-my-user-styles-from-stylish-for-firefox-to-stylus\n    Stylus doesn't apply userstyles to the browser UI or the built-in pages like about:addons because there's no WebExtension API for dynamic application of CSS. You may use another extension that runs an externally installed companion utility to modify userChrome.css and userContent.css and restart Firefox. This restriction is imposed intentionally by Mozilla for security purposes. We don't plan to incorporate the above-mentioned workaround. See https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Styling-Firefox-UI\n    Export backups of your database frequently. The main reason we've kept the \"beta\" status for so long is because WebExtension support is still a work in progress for Firefox. Many Firefox specific workarounds have been implemented, but backing up your DB regularly will save you a lot of aggravation should something happen to go wrong.","weeklyDownloads":2220,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Stylus Team","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13438734/"},"developers":[{"name":"Jeremy Schomery","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/11568224/"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/184/184539.png?modified=1622132703","width":700,"height":517,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/184/184539.jpg?modified=1622132703","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":394,"caption":"Promo"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/184/184538.png?modified=1622132703","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/184/184538.jpg?modified=1622132703","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":334,"caption":"Editor"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/200/200986.png?modified=1622132705","width":843,"height":597,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200986.jpg?modified=1622132705","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":377,"caption":"Manager -

Allows improperly encoded videos to properly fit ultrawide and superwide displays (e.g. 21:9) — and it attempts to do so automatically.","fullDescription":"Need to remove unnecessary black bars from this youtube video you're watching? Ultrawidify is here for you. It should work on Youtube, Netflix, Twitch, Vimeo, Streamable (and on embedded videos that are hosted on these sites). It may work elsewhere as well, but no guarantees.\n\nImportant note: This addon is only tested and intended to work with Google Chrome specifically. If you're using a different browser, you're on your own. No, Edge is not Google Chrome (and neither is any other chromium-based browser).\n\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n1. AUTOMATIC ASPECT RATIO DETECTION\nEnsures that video will be cropped without you having to lift a finger. It even re-adjusts crop if aspect ratio changes mid-video. Autodetection is not 100% accurate and has some limitations, but it's accurate enough for most cases.\n\nAutodetection is not supported on all sites. Some sites (e.g. Netflix, Disney+, Hulu) use DRM in order to prevent video piracy, and such protection measures interfere with automatic aspect ratio detection.\n\n\n2. MANUAL ASPECT RATIO CORRECTION\nFor sites that do not support automatic aspect ratio detection, Ultrawidify allows you to manually crop the video. The extension allows you to crop to these aspect ratios by default:\n\n    Fit Width (shortcut: W)\n    Fit Height (shortcut: E)\n    21:9 (shortcut: D)\n    18:9 (or 2:1; shortcut: X)\n    16:9 (shortcut: S)\n\n\nYou can also reset the aspect ratio back to the initial aspect ratio (shortcut: R).\n\nNote that some sites may define keyboard shortcuts that interfere with the shortcuts defined by this extension. In such cases, the shortcuts defined by this extension may not work.\n\n\n3. STRETCH VIDEO\nYou paid for the entire monitor, so you're gonna use all the monitor — even if it means stretching the video into complete garbage? Ultrawidify's got you covered with a bunch of different options:\n\n    Don't: for men of culture\n    Basic: for people who just don't care, at all. (This option does not remove the black bars\n    Hybrid: crops the video first and then stretches the video to fill the remaining space\n    Thin borders: only stretch the video if the black borders are _really_ thin\n    4:3 (src): not all people are men of culture. Some people torture others by posting 4:3 content stretched to 16:9. This option makes the video 4:3 again.\n    16:9 (src): ensures that the video is stretched (or squeezed) to 16:9.\n\n\n\n4. ALIGN VIDEO TO SOMETHING OTHER THAN CENTER\nThere's a few people who aren't bothered by the vertical bars you get when watching 16:9 content on a 21:9 monitor. However, they would much prefer if instead of having two thinner black bars on either side of the video, they'd have just one bigger black bar on one side.\n\nThat way, they can watch their 16:9 video on full screen while also having a bigger space to put their League of Legends chat¹ in while waiting for their match to start.\n\n---\n¹or something like that.IDK I'm more of a CSGO guy, so I'll take the guy who asked for this at face value.\n\n\n5. MANUAL OVERRIDE FOR PLAYER DETECTION\nUltrawidify not working on a site? It's possibe that Ultrawidify can detect the video, but not the video player. If that happens, you can head over to 'Advanced settings' tab in the popup and specify the player element. You can do that by specifying the player node index (gradually increase the number from 1 to ~10) or — if you know how HTML and CSS work — providing the query selector.\n\nSometimes, Ultrawidify won't work because of the quirks in site's CSS. If you know how to fix that kind of issues, 'advanced settings' section of the popup allows you to do so.\n\nRemember: sharing is caring. If you manage to fix a website using these tools, consider sharing the solution via email or github.\n\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\n1. WHY DOESN'T AUTODETECTION WORK ON <website>?\nBecause the site utilizes DRM/anti-piracy measures, which prevent autodetection from working.\n\n\n2. WHY DOESN'T AUTODETECTION DETECT ASPECT RATIO CHANGES INSTANTANEOUSLY?\nDue to performance reasons, Ultrawidify only checks for aspect ratio changes about three times per second. That means that aspect ratio detection may \"lag\" by about 300 milliseconds.\n\nWhile the frequency of aspect ratio checks can be increased, Ultrawidify can only check the currently displayed frame. As such, it will always lag by at least one frame.\n\nNote that increasing the frequency of aspect ratio checks may result in Chrome becoming laggy and, in extreme cases, even memory leaks as browser's garbage collection is unable to keep up with the scripts.\n\n\n3. AUTODETECTION HAS [INSERT A PROBLEM WITH MOVIE CREDITS OR BAKED-IN SUBTITLES]\nAspect ratio detection requires a little bit of math to be done. Because doing too much maths can result in your browser not responding properly or even crashing, autodetection must find a compromise between accuracy and doing as little math as possible in order to establish the aspect ratio.\n\nIssues with text are result of these tradeoffs. If it bothers you that much, you can disable autodetection (either temporarily, by manually setting aspect ratio, or forever).\n\nIf you know what you're doing, you can go to extension option and tweak aspect ratio detection parameters.\n\n\n4. CAN I ADD A CUSTOM ASPECT RATIO/CUSTOM KEYBOARD SHORTCUT?\nYes, but it requires some effort as the UI is currently mildly to majorly broken.\n\n\n5. THE EXTENSION BROKE A SITE / DOESN'T WORK FOR A GIVEN SITE\nYou can submit a bug report via email or github. Please include all the details the email/issue template asks for.\n\nIf the site requires a subscription or is geo-locked, you can also save the page with \"Save Page WE\" extension and attach the file to the email (if submitting a github issue, you need to put the html file in a zip archive). This will make my life a bit easier.\n\n\n6.
